As a security researcher you will often be required to find specific files/folders on a system based on various conditions ranging from, but not limited to the following:

    filename
    size
    user/group
    date modified
    date accessed
    Its keyword contents
Therefore, we can do this using the following syntax:

What we can do                            Syntax                                                Real example of syntax
1.Find files based on filename            find [directory path] -type f -name [filename]        find /home/Andy -type f -name sales.txt
2.Find Directory based on directory name  find [directory path] -type d -name [filename]	    find /home/Andy -type d -name pictures
3.Find files based on size                find [directory path] -type f -size [size]	        find /home/Andy -type f -size 10c (c for bytes, k for kilobytes M megabytes G for gigabytes)
4.Find files based on username            find [directory path] -type f -user [username]	    find /etc/server -type f -user john
5.Find files based on group               find [directory path] -type f -group [group name]	    find /etc/server -type f -group teamstar
6.Find files with a specific keyword      grep -iRl [directory path/keyword]                    grep -iRl '/folderA/flag'

**placing: 2>/dev/null at the end of your find command can help filter your results to exclude files/directories that you do not have permission to.**
**CTRL+L allows you to clear the screen quicker rather than typing 'clear' all the time.**
